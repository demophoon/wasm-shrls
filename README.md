SHRLS - Web Assembly
====================

A URL shortener written in TinyGo running in Web Assembly


Why another URL shortener?
--------------------------
This is my pet project I use to test out new-to-me technologies I have an
interest in learning about. First it was learning more about web servers, then
it turned into learning about Go, now I'm playing around with web assembly and
how to deploy it.
