# SHRLS - Web Assembly

A URL shortener written in TinyGo running in Web Assembly


## Development

This repo utilizes Nix for most of the setup, however that is still something
I'm learning so a few things are needed in addition to what Nix sets up.

### Requirements
 - TinyGo (v0.26 or greater)
 - Go (v1.18 or greater)
 - Spin (v0.7 or greater)


## Why another URL shortener?

This is my pet project I use to test out new-to-me technologies I have an
interest in learning about. First it was learning more about web servers, then
it turned into learning about Go, now I'm playing around with web assembly and
how to deploy it.
